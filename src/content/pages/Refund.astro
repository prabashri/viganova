    <p>
      We facilitate apostille and document attestation steps in India by coordinating with
      <strong> Notary</strong>, <strong>Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM)</strong>, and the
      <strong> Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)</strong> via authorised/representative partners.
      Refunds depend on the <span class="bold">stage</span> of your order, as detailed below.
    </p>

    <h2 id="definitions">1) Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Start of Notary”</strong> means your file is formally handed over for notarisation or placed in the Notary queue (whichever occurs first).</li>
      <li><strong>“Physical Document”</strong> means an original/physical certificate provided to us for processing.</li>
      <li><strong>“Scanned Copy”</strong> includes PDF/PNG/JPG or images sent via email/WhatsApp/other channels for printing & submission where allowed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="eligibility">2) Refund eligibility by stage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>After Notary has started</strong> (handover or queueing confirmed):
        <br />➡️ <strong>No refund</strong> of service fees. Government/office fees and any third-party costs are non-refundable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Before Notary has started</strong>, when we already received your
        <em>physical document</em> and initiated coordination with partners:
        <br />➡️ Refund of <strong>75% of the service fee</strong> (we retain <strong>25%</strong> as service/administration),
        <em>plus</em> deduction of actual <strong>courier/logistics</strong> already incurred.
        Government/office fees, if already paid on your behalf, are non-refundable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Before Notary has started</strong>, if only <em>scanned copies</em> were shared and no third-party costs incurred:
        <br />➡️ Refund of <strong>75% of the service fee</strong> (25% retained as service/administration).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-s col-base-70">
      Note: There is no mandated “standard” retention; <strong>25%</strong> is our service/administration charge to cover consultation,
      document checks, file preparation, coordination, and operational overheads.
    </p>

    <h2 id="nonrefundable">3) Always non-refundable</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Government/office fees</strong> (Notary, SDM, MEA, outsourced counters).</li>
      <li><strong>Courier/logistics</strong> already used (pickup/return/transfer between offices).</li>
      <li><strong>Third-party expenses</strong> already incurred (e.g., translations, photos, true-copy/affidavits, printing).</li>
      <li><strong>Payment gateway charges</strong> where non-refundable by the gateway (if any).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="howto">4) How to request a refund</h2>

      <li>Email us from your registered email with <span class="bold">Order ID</span>, applicant name, and phone.</li>
      <li>If physical documents are with us, we will arrange return (charges apply) before finalising the refund.</li>
      <li>We'll confirm the processing <span class="bold">stage</span> and eligible amount per this policy.</li>

      <li>Processing typically within <span class="bold">7-10 business days</span> after eligibility confirmation (bank/gateway timelines may vary).</li>
    </ul>
