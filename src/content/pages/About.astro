    {/* Mission / Vision */}
    <h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>{companyName}</strong> is focused on accelerating India’s clean
      energy transition through practical, production-grade hydrogen solutions.
      We believe green hydrogen is not a distant promise — it’s an essential
      building block for an industrial future that is cleaner, safer, and
      independent of fossil imports.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aim to lead the future energy industry by advancing electrolyzer
      technology, hydrogen storage, and Power-to-Gas systems that can operate at
      scale. Our work is driven by one simple idea: a pollution-free India is
      not optional. It’s urgent.

    </p>

    {/* Technology pillars */}
    <h2 id="what-we-build">What We Build</h2>

    <h3>Electrolyzer Systems</h3>
    <p>
      Our water electrolysis systems are optimized for green hydrogen
      production. We focus on catalytic efficiency (OER / HER performance),
      durability under continuous load, and stack design suitable for
      industrial operation — not just lab demos.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" heading="Goal">
      High-output hydrogen with lower energy cost per kilogram.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h3>Advanced Hybrid Hydrogen Storage</h3>
    <p>
      Hydrogen is only valuable if you can store and move it safely.
      We are developing a hybrid compressed gas / liquid hydrogen storage
      approach that reduces boil-off losses (a pain point in pure liquid
      storage) while maintaining the volumetric efficiency industry needs.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" heading="Goal">
      Practical storage solutions that serve mobility, backup power,
      and industrial hydrogen logistics.
    </CalloutBox>

    <h3>Power-to-Gas (P2G)</h3>
    <p>
      Power-to-Gas systems convert excess renewable electricity into storable,
      dispatchable chemical energy. We are building integrated P2G solutions to
      support both hydrogen production and energy buffering — so clean power can
      be generated when it’s windy/sunny and used when it’s not.
    </p>

    <CalloutBox type="tip" heading="Goal">
      Enable grid resilience and energy independence using green fuel
      instead of fossil reserves.
    </CalloutBox>

    {/* Research credibility */}
    <h2 id="research">Research & Scientific Backbone</h2>
    <p>
      Our founders’ backgrounds span electrochemistry, high-performance
      catalyst development, membrane interfaces, and system-level power
      engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Academic work in electrochemical energy systems — including OER (oxygen
      evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) pathways — is
      being translated directly into commercially relevant stack designs. This
      is how we intend to differentiate: not by branding, but by science that
      ships.
    </p>
    <p class="bold">
      We believe that India can be a producer of world-class hydrogen
      technology, not just an importer of it.
    </p>

    {/* Vision */}
    <h2 id="vision">Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We are building toward large-scale deployment of green hydrogen
      infrastructure in India — not just for heavy industry, but for mobility,
      grid support, agriculture, and decentralized energy security.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see hydrogen not as a trend, but as the backbone of a circular,
      decarbonized energy economy. Cleaner cities. Exportable tech. Skilled
      local manufacturing. Real climate impact.
    </p>

    <p class="p-1 my-1 br-left-thicker-primary bold opacity-80">
      A pollution-free future isn't a pitch line for us.
      It's the reason {companyName} exists.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ceo-message">Founders’ Message</h2>
    <div class="my-2 p-1 bg-base-10 br-r text-base col-base-90">
      <p>
        At <strong>Viga Nova Green Energy</strong>, our journey began with a simple conviction — 
        that clean hydrogen must become the heart of a sustainable India.
      </p>
      <p>
        As researchers who have spent years advancing electrochemical energy systems, 
        we witnessed first-hand how science can bridge the gap between possibility and impact. 
        The transition from laboratory insight to industrial reality is never easy, 
        but it is the only path to a truly carbon-neutral future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to transform hydrogen into a practical, affordable, and scalable 
        solution for industries, transportation, and communities. Through innovation in 
        <strong>electrolyzer technology</strong>, <strong>hybrid hydrogen storage</strong>, and 
        <strong>Power-to-Gas integration</strong>, we are building the foundations of a cleaner 
        energy ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        India’s future demands both energy security and environmental responsibility. 
        Viga Nova is committed to uniting these goals through science-driven engineering, 
        collaboration, and a spirit of continuous discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        We invite our partners, investors, and fellow researchers to join us in this endeavor —
        to create a future where prosperity and sustainability advance together.
