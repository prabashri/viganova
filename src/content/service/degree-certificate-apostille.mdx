    question: "Do degree certificates require HRD or is SDM enough?",
    answer: "Many recipients prefer HRD/Education Department for degrees; some accept SDM. We follow the destination’s written checklist and your State rules, then confirm the shortest compliant route.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to send the original degree certificate?",
    answer: "Not always. Sticker apostille often requires the original. If your recipient accepts, e-Apostille (QR) on a notarized copy keeps your original safe."
  },
  {
    question: "Is e-Sanad available for my university?",
    answer: "If your university/board supports e-Sanad, we’ll prefer that digital route. Some institutions add genuineness/verification fees; timelines vary."
  },
  {
    question: "Provisional vs final degree—what should I apostille?",
    answer: "Most destinations prefer the final degree. Use provisional only when explicitly accepted or if the final is pending."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will a degree apostille take?",
    answer: "SDM: ~2–3 working days once in process. HRD/e-Sanad depends on State/university verification and can take longer; we share a firm ETA after review.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost?",
    answer: `Our SDM bundle for many degree cases is ${inr(price('degreeSdmBundle') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document (Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA + secure return). If HRD/e-Sanad is required, we quote it separately after verifying your route. Prices current as of ${PRICES_LAST_UPDATED}.`
  },
  {
    question: "Can you deliver abroad?",
    answer: "Yes — we ship worldwide via DHL, Blue Dart, or other standard couriers with tracking and insurance."

## Sticker vs e-Apostille (QR) & e-Sanad

- **Sticker Apostille (physical):** MEA sticker on the original degree — common for immigration/visa.  
- **e-Apostille (QR):** MEA digital apostille with QR verification — fast when copies are accepted.  
- **e-Sanad:** official digital pipeline for participating universities/boards; used where available.

<CalloutBox type="cta-secondary">
  For **non-Hague** destinations, we manage **Notary → HRD/SDM → MEA → Embassy/Consulate**.

## Documents Required

- **Degree certificate** (final; provisional only if accepted)  
- **Marksheet(s)** or **consolidated** (if requested)  
- **Passport** (first/last page)  
- **University/Board verification** or **e-Sanad details** (if State requires)  
- **Notarized copy** for copy/e-Apostille path (when permitted)

---

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** — share scans; we confirm **SDM vs HRD/e-Sanad** and **Sticker vs e-Apostille**.  
2. **Pickup/courier & verification** — we pre-check names, roll/USN, dates to avoid rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(if needed)* → **SDM (Delhi)** **or** **State HRD/Education** (or **e-Sanad**).  
4. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker or e-Apostille (QR).  
5. **Digital share** — scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link.  
6. **Secure return** — tracked, insured delivery of originals.

---

## Timelines

- **SDM route:** generally **~2–3 working days** once in process.  
- **HRD/e-Sanad:** varies by State/university queues; we’ll confirm your **firm ETA** after review.

---

## Original vs Copy

- If the recipient requires physical verification, choose **Sticker on the original degree**.  
- If **e-Apostille** is accepted, a **notarized copy** avoids sending the original.  
- Always follow the **recipient’s written requirement**.

---

## Special Cases

- **Provisional degree:** use only if accepted or final is pending.  
- **Old/faded degree:** request a **fresh university reprint** before apostille.  
- **Name change/mismatch:** we’ll suggest **affidavit**, **Gazette**, or **university correction** (fastest compliant path).  
- **Applying from abroad:** parents/guardians can submit with ID and authorization.

---

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Doorstep pickup in India** & **worldwide courier return**  
- Proactive **WhatsApp/email** updates  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** + live tracking

---

## How to Start

1. **Send scans** of the degree (and marksheets if requested) + the recipient’s requirement.  
2. Receive your **route (SDM/HRD/e-Sanad), all-inclusive price, and ETA**.  
3. **Schedule pickup**, track progress, and receive your apostilled degree — **securely delivered worldwide**.
