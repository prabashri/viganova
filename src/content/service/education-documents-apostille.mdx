## HRD vs SDM Route â€” How It Works

- **Standard (many cases):** Notary â†’ **SDM (Delhi)** â†’ **MEA (Sticker or e-Apostille)**  
- **When required:** **HRD/State Education Dept** â†’ MEA (varies by State/university)  
- **e-Sanad route:** used when your university/board is listed in Indiaâ€™s e-Sanad portal.  

Weâ€™ll check your university, document type, and destinationâ€™s checklist to suggest the **shortest compliant path**.

---

## Documents Required

- **Degree / Diploma / Provisional / Marksheet(s)**  
- **Passport** (first & last page)  
- **University verification / e-Sanad proof** (if applicable)  
- **Notarized copy** (only if e-Apostille/copy route is allowed)

---

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** â€” share scans of your documents.  
2. **Pickup or courier** â€” we verify details and confirm route.  
3. **Notary** *(if required)* â†’ **SDM (Delhi)** or **HRD/Education Dept**.  
4. **MEA Apostille** â€” Sticker or e-Apostille (QR).  
5. **Digital confirmation** â€” PDF copy + verification link.  
6. **Secure return** â€” tracked, insured delivery to your address (India or abroad).

---

## Processing Time

- **SDM route:** typically **2â€“3 working days** once in process.  
- **HRD/e-Sanad:** varies by State/university queue; weâ€™ll give a **firm ETA** after review.

---

## Original vs Copy â€” Which to Choose

- If the recipient demands physical verification â†’ **Sticker on the original**.  
- If they accept digital verification â†’ **e-Apostille (QR)** on a notarized copy saves time and keeps originals safe.  
- We always follow the **recipientâ€™s written checklist** for accuracy.
