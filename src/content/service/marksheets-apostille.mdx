    question: "Do marksheets need HRD or is SDM enough?",
    answer: "Many destinations prefer HRD/Education for higher-education docs; some accept SDM. We follow the recipientâ€™s written checklist and your Stateâ€™s policy to choose the shortest compliant route.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to send original marksheets?",
    answer: "Sticker apostille often requires originals. If your recipient allows, e-Apostille (QR) on notarized copies can work and keeps your originals safe."
  },
  {
    question: "Is e-Sanad available for my university/board?",
    answer: "If your Board/University is on e-Sanad, we prefer that digital route. Some institutions add genuineness/verification fees; timelines vary."
  },
  {
    question: "Which sheets should I apostilleâ€”semester-wise or consolidated?",
    answer: "Follow the receiving authorityâ€™s list. Many ask for degree + consolidated (or final semester). Weâ€™ll confirm the minimum valid set after review."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take?",
    answer: "SDM: ~2â€“3 working days once in process. HRD/e-Sanad depends on State/university verification and can take longer. We confirm a firm ETA upfront.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost?",
    answer: `Our SDM bundle for many marksheet cases is ${inr(price('marksheetSdmBundle') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document (Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA + secure return). If HRD/e-Sanad is required, we quote it separately after verifying your route. Prices current as of ${PRICES_LAST_UPDATED}.`
  },
  {
    question: "Can you deliver abroad?",
    answer: "Yes â€” we ship worldwide via DHL, Blue Dart, or other standard couriers with tracking and insurance."
  },
  {
    question: "Lost or damaged marksheetâ€”can I use a duplicate?",
    answer: "Yes, if itâ€™s officially reissued by your Board/University. Weâ€™ll advise if a fresh reprint is recommended before apostille."
  }

## Sticker vs e-Apostille (QR) & e-Sanad

- **Sticker Apostille (physical):** MEA sticker on the document â€” common for visa/immigration.  
- **e-Apostille (QR):** MEA digital apostille with QR verification â€” faster when copies are accepted.  
- **e-Sanad:** official digital pipeline for supported Boards/Universities; used where available.

<CalloutBox type="info">
  For **non-Hague** destinations, we continue the chain to **Embassy/Consulate attestation** after MEA.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** â€” share scans; we confirm **SDM vs HRD/e-Sanad** and **Sticker vs e-Apostille**.  
2. **Pickup/courier & verification** â€” we pre-check names, roll/USN, and dates to avoid rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(if needed)* â†’ **SDM (Delhi)** **or** **State HRD/Education** (or **e-Sanad**).  
4. **MEA Apostille** â€” Sticker or e-Apostille (QR).  
5. **Digital confirmation** â€” scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link.  
6. **Secure return** â€” tracked, insured delivery of originals.

## Processing Time

- **SDM route:** typically **2â€“3 working days** once in process.  
- **HRD/e-Sanad:** varies by State/university queues â€” we share a **firm ETA** after review.
