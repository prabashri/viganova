## Who Needs a Transfer or Leaving Certificate Apostille?

Students applying abroad for **school admission**, **dependent visas**, or **residency documentation** often need their **Transfer/Leaving Certificate (TC/LC)** apostilled by Indiaâ€™s **Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)**.

---

## What We Handle

- **School Transfer Certificate (TC) / Leaving Certificate (LC)**  
- **Character / Bonafide Certificates** (if required by destination)  
- **Notarized declarations or affidavits** related to school admission

> Not sure if your TC qualifies? Share a scan â€” weâ€™ll confirm eligibility and the fastest compliant route.

---

## Sticker vs e-Apostille (QR)

- **Sticker Apostille:** A physical MEA sticker affixed to your original TC â€” often required for visa or admission verification.  
- **e-Apostille (QR):** A digital apostille from MEA with QR verification â€” faster and fully valid for countries that accept e-documents.

We recommend the best mode based on your **destination country** and **application type**.

---

## Typical Route (School Documents)

**Notary â†’ SDM (Delhi) â†’ MEA (Sticker or e-Apostille QR)**  
Some State Boards may require additional verification â€” weâ€™ll confirm this before processing.

---

## Fee Structure

- **VerifiedApostille SDM Bundle â€” {inr(price('transferCertificateSdmBundle') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document**  
  Includes **Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA Apostille + premium pickup/return**.  
- **Multi-document discount:** automatic **5â€“10%** off.  
- **Add-ons (only if needed):** translations, affidavit/corrections, or fresh reissue guidance.  
- **MEA fee:** â‚¹50/â‚¹90 (already included in the bundle).

<CalloutBox type="info" class="my-1">
  School-level certificates usually donâ€™t need HRD.  
  The route is **Notary â†’ SDM â†’ MEA** unless your recipient explicitly asks for a different authority.  
  See: <Anchor href="https://easyapostille.in/resources/document-authentication-india-coc-hrd-vs-sdm-home-state-attestation/">SDM vs HRD vs Home Department Guide</Anchor>.

## Documents Required

- **Transfer/Leaving Certificate (TC/LC)** â€” clear scan or original  
- **Passport / Aadhaar** (student ID)  
- **Parent/Guardian Authorization Letter** (if student abroad â€” weâ€™ll share a format)  
- **Affidavit/Gazette** (if name/date corrections exist)  
- **Courier address** for pickup and secure return (if originals required)

---

## Process Overview

1. **Share scans** â€” we check eligibility and confirm the exact route.  
2. **Confirm & quote** â€” you receive a written route, ETA, and price.  
3. **Pickup or courier submission** (doorstep service in India).  
4. **Apostille process:** Notary â†’ SDM â†’ MEA (Sticker or e-Apostille).  
5. **Delivery:** receive your **scan/e-Apostille PDF + QR link**, and **secure courier** return of originals.

---

## Original vs Copy â€” What to Choose?

- For **school admissions or visa documentation**, authorities usually demand **Sticker on the original**.  
- For **digital submission** or online applications, **e-Apostille (QR)** may be sufficient.  
- Always follow the **recipientâ€™s written checklist**.
