    question: "Do I need to send the original marriage certificate?",
    answer: "Often yes for Sticker apostille. If your recipient accepts, e-Apostille (QR) on a notarized copy may be enough—we confirm after an eligibility check.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Are religious/ceremony certificates (church/temple/Arya Samaj) enough?",
    answer: "No. MEA issues apostille on the civil Marriage Registration Certificate from the Registrar/Sub-Registrar/SDM. Ceremony certificates can be attached as supporting documents."
  },
  {
    question: "Name change after marriage—will that be a problem?",
    answer: "Not usually. If there’s a spelling change or surname adoption, we may add an affidavit or Gazette copy. We’ll advise the simplest compliant path."
  },
  {
    question: "Court marriage or inter-state marriage—any difference?",
    answer: "Both are fine as long as you have the civil registration certificate. Inter-state documents may need translation if issued in a regional language."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take?",
    answer: "Most certificates finish in ~2–3 working days once in process. If State Home Dept is required (instead of SDM) or a reprint/translation is needed, timelines can extend. We share a firm ETA upfront.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Can a family member apply while we are abroad?",
    answer: "Yes. A parent/relative can submit with a short authorization letter and ID copies. We share the exact template."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you deliver abroad?",
    answer: "Yes — we ship worldwide via DHL, Blue Dart, or other standard couriers with tracking and insurance."

An **MEA apostille** makes your Indian **Marriage Registration Certificate** valid in **Hague Convention** countries.  
**VerifiedApostille** helps couples in India and NRIs abroad complete the process quickly and securely.

## Sticker vs e-Apostille (QR)

- **Sticker Apostille (physical):** MEA sticker on your certificate — commonly preferred by civil offices/visa centers.  
- **e-Apostille (QR):** Digital apostille with QR verification — faster and shareable when the recipient accepts copies.

<CalloutBox type="info" class="my-1">
  For **non-Hague** destinations, we extend the chain to **Embassy/Consulate attestation** after MEA.  
  See: <Anchor href="https://easyapostille.in/resources/hague-vs-non-hague-apostille-or-embassy-attestation/">Hague vs Non-Hague explainer</Anchor>.

## Fee Structure

- **VerifiedApostille SDM bundle — {inr(price('marriageSdmBundle') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document**  
  Includes **Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA apostille + premium pickup/return** with WhatsApp/email updates.  
- If your destination insists on **State Home Department**, or if **translation/affidavits** are required, we’ll quote the difference before you proceed.  
- **Multi-document discount:** **5–10%** auto-applied.

<CalloutBox type="info" class="my-1">
  A marriage certificate is a <Anchor href="/services/personal-documents-apostille/">**personal document**</Anchor>.  
  Depending on your state/recipient rules, MEA may require <Anchor href="https://easyapostille.in/resources/document-authentication-india-coc-hrd-vs-sdm-home-state-attestation/">**SDM or State Home Department**</Anchor> first.

## Documents Required

- **Marriage Registration Certificate** (scan or original as advised)  
  - Issued by **Registrar/Sub-Registrar/SDM** (civil registration)  
  - Religious/ceremony certificates **alone** are **not** sufficient  
- **Passports** of both spouses (first/last pages)  
- **Authorization + ID** of submitting family member (if the couple is abroad)  
- **Affidavit/Gazette** for name updates (if applicable)  
- **Certified translation** (if not in English/Hindi and required by recipient)

---

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** — share a scan; we confirm **Sticker vs e-Apostille** and **original vs copy** per the recipient’s checklist.  
2. **Pickup/courier & verification** — we pre-check names/dates and fix gaps to avoid rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(if needed)* → **SDM (Delhi)** or **State Home Dept** *(as required)*  
4. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker or e-Apostille (QR)  
5. **Digital confirmation** — scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link  
6. **Secure return** — tracked, insured delivery (India & worldwide)

---

## Timelines

Most marriage-certificate apostilles complete in **~2–3 working days** once in process.  
State-route demands, reprints, or translations can add time — we provide your **firm ETA** upfront.

---

## Original vs Copy

- **Spouse/dependent visa** cases often require the **original** with **Sticker**.  
- If **e-Apostille** is accepted, a **notarized copy** can be faster and keeps the original free for other uses.  
- Always follow the **recipient’s written requirement**.

---

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Doorstep pickup in India** and **worldwide courier delivery**  
- Real-time **WhatsApp/email** updates  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** + tracking ID on dispatch

---

## How to Start

1. **Send a scan** of the Marriage Registration Certificate + the recipient’s checklist.  
2. Receive your **route, all-inclusive price, and ETA**.  
3. **Schedule pickup/courier**, track progress, and get your apostilled certificate — **securely delivered worldwide**.
