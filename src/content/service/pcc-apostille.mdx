    question: "What’s the difference between RPO and General PCC apostille?",
    answer:
      "RPO/PSK-issued PCCs typically go directly to MEA (no Notary/SDM). Police/State-issued PCCs usually require Notary → SDM → MEA. We confirm your route after a quick format/seal check.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to send my original PCC?",
    answer:
      "For RPO/PSK direct MEA, the original is usually required. For e-Apostille or copies, acceptance depends on the recipient’s policy — we confirm before filing.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Is notarization required for PCC?",
    answer:
      "Not for original RPO/PSK PCCs going direct to MEA. Notarization applies when using a true copy or when your PCC type isn’t accepted directly."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does PCC apostille take?",
    answer:
      "RPO/PSK (direct MEA) typically finishes in 2–3 working days. General (Notary + SDM + MEA) is ~3–5 days depending on State checks.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer:
      `RPO/PSK PCC — ${inr(price('pccRpoMeaApostille'))}; General PCC — ${inr(price('pccMeaApostille'))}. Both include MEA apostille and secure courier return.`
  },
  {
    question: "Is e-Apostille accepted for PCC?",
    answer:
      "Often yes, if your destination accepts digital verification. Choose Sticker when physical inspection is required."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my PCC is older or unclear?",
    answer:
      "If your PCC is older than 6 months or lacks clear seals/signatures/QR, we may suggest a fresh issue to avoid rejection."
  }

An **MEA apostille** makes your Indian **Police Clearance Certificate (PCC)** valid in **Hague Convention** countries.  
**VerifiedApostille** guides you on the correct route and delivers worldwide via **DHL / Blue Dart**.

## Routes: RPO Direct MEA vs General (Notary → SDM → MEA)

- **RPO/PSK PCC (original):** usually **direct MEA apostille** — **no Notary/SDM** → faster and lower handling.  
- **Police/Commissioner/State PCC** or **true copy/print:** typically **Notary → SDM/State → MEA** (General route).  
- We always follow your **recipient’s written checklist**; if a State route is demanded, we use that path even for RPO PCC.

---

## Fee Structure

- **RPO/PSK (Direct MEA):** **{inr(price('pccRpoMeaApostille'))}**  
- **General PCC (Notary + SDM + MEA):** **{inr(price('pccMeaApostille'))}**  

**Includes:** MEA apostille, premium courier return, and WhatsApp/email updates.  
**Multi-document discount:** **5–10%** auto-applied.

**Add-ons (only if needed):**
- State/Home Department route (if destination insists)  
- Affidavits / certified translations  
- Fresh PCC issuance guidance (govt. fees extra)  
- Embassy/Consulate attestation for **non-Hague** destinations

<CalloutBox type="info" class="my-1">
  For non-Hague countries, we extend the chain to **Embassy/Consulate attestation** after MEA.  
  See: <Anchor href="https://easyapostille.in/resources/hague-vs-non-hague-apostille-or-embassy-attestation/">Hague vs Non-Hague</Anchor>.

## Documents Required

- **PCC** (original or scan, as advised after eligibility check)  
- **Passport** (first & last page) of the applicant  
- **Authorization letter + ID** for a representative (if applying on your behalf)  
- Any **additional proof** only if requested by the destination authority

**Accepted PCC types:**
- **PSK / RPO** PCC  
- **Police/Commissioner’s Office** PCC  
- **State**-issued PCC  
- **Notarized true copies** (only where the recipient permits copies)

---

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** — share a scan; we confirm **direct MEA vs General**, and **Sticker vs e-Apostille**.  
2. **Pickup/courier & verification** — we prepare the file to avoid rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(only if required)*  
4. **SDM / State Home Department** *(General route cases)*  
5. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker or e-Apostille (QR)  
6. **Digital share** — scanned copy / e-Apostille PDF + verification link  
7. **Secure delivery** — tracked, insured return of originals

---

## Processing Time

- **RPO/PSK (direct MEA):** **~2–3 working days** once in process  
- **General (Notary + SDM + MEA):** **~3–5 working days** depending on State checks

We provide your **firm ETA** upfront.

---

## Original vs Copy

- **Visa/immigration** cases often require the **original PCC** with a **Sticker apostille**.  
- If **e-Apostille** is accepted, a **notarized copy** can be faster and easier to reuse.  
- See guide: <Anchor href="https://easyapostille.in/resources/apostille-on-original-vs-copy-certificate-india/">Original vs Copy for Apostille</Anchor>.

---

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Doorstep pickup in India** and **worldwide courier return**  
- Real-time updates via **WhatsApp/email**  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** + tracking ID on dispatch

---

## How to Start

1. **Send a scan** of your PCC + the recipient’s requirement.  
2. Receive a **written route (RPO direct vs General), all-inclusive price, and ETA**.  
3. **Schedule pickup/courier**, track progress, and receive your apostilled PCC — **securely delivered worldwide**.
