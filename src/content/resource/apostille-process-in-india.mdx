    speakable: true
  - question: "How much does an apostille cost?"

If you plan to **study, work, migrate, or transact abroad**, you'll likely be asked for an **apostille** on your Indian documents. This guide from **VerifiedApostille** breaks down the meaning, the Indian process (Sticker and **e-Apostille QR**), and how to pick the right route.

## 1) What is an apostille?

An **apostille** is an internationally recognized **certificate of authenticity** issued under the **Hague Convention of 5 October 1961**. It confirms a public document’s origin so it can be used in **Hague Convention countries** *without* further consular legalization.

- **Indian authority:** the **Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)**.  
- **Where it works:** Hague member countries; for non-members, use **embassy attestation**.

## 2) Why is it required?

Authorities abroad want confidence that your document (degree, birth/marriage certificate, PCC, POA, invoices, etc.) is **genuine**. The apostille aligns verification standards so recipients can **trust** the issuing country’s signatures and seals.

## 3) What does an apostille look like?

India issues:
- A **Sticker apostille** (physical label affixed to the document), and  
- An **e-Apostille (QR)** — a **digitally signed** certificate with a **QR code** for online verification.

Typical fields include the Hague title, country, signer’s name/capacity, seal, date/number, and issuing authority details.

  caption="Fields on apostille certificate follow Hague standards; India also supports e-Apostille with QR."

## 4) Apostille vs. Attestation (what’s the difference?)

“**Apostille**” applies to **Hague members**; “**Attestation**” (legalization) applies to **non-Hague** countries via their **embassy/consulate**.

<Table>
| Feature | Apostille | Embassy Attestation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Destination | Hague Convention members | Non-Hague countries |
| India authority | MEA (Sticker / e-Apostille QR) | Embassy/Consulate after MEA |
| Typical speed | Faster (often 1–3 working days) | Longer (varies by mission) |
| Extra consular step | Not needed | Required |
</Table>

<CalloutBox type="note" heading="Quick check" showIcon={true}>
If your destination is in the Hague list, you need an <strong>apostille</strong>—not embassy attestation.  
See: <Anchor href="/resource/hague-vs-non-hague-apostille-or-embassy-attestation/">Hague vs Non-Hague</Anchor>.
</CalloutBox>

## 5) India routes at a glance (education • personal • business)

Your route depends on the **document category** and the recipient’s checklist:

- **Education** (Degree, Marksheet, TC):  
  Notary → **SDM** *or* **HRD/Education** → **MEA** (Sticker / e-Apostille).  
  Start here: <Anchor href="/service/education-documents-apostille/">Education Apostille</Anchor>

- **Personal** (Birth, Marriage, PCC, Affidavits):  
  Notary → **SDM/State Home** → **MEA**.  
  See: <Anchor href="/service/personal-documents-apostille/">Personal Apostille</Anchor>

- **Business / Commercial** (POA, MOA/AOA, Incorporation, Invoices):  
  Notary → **Chamber of Commerce (CoC)** → **MEA**.  
  Details: <Anchor href="/service/business-document-apostille/">Business Document Apostille</Anchor>

<CalloutBox type="info" heading="Sticker or e-Apostille?" showIcon={true}>
Choose **Sticker** if the authority insists on a physical label or in-person verification.  
Choose **e-Apostille (QR)** when the destination accepts digital verification—faster sharing, easy re-use.

## 6) Step-by-step: How to get an apostille in India

### A) Sticker Apostille (physical)
1. **Eligibility & route** (SDM/Home/HRD/CoC as applicable).  
2. **Pre-auth** (Notary → SDM/HRD/CoC).  
3. **MEA** applies the **sticker** and returns the document.  
4. **Delivery**: tracked courier (India & abroad).

### B) e-Apostille (QR)
1. Confirm **acceptance** by your recipient/country.  
2. Use the official **e-Sanad** flow where supported (some institutions require prior verification).  
3. Receive a **digitally signed** e-Apostille PDF with **QR**.

## 7) Costs & timelines — what to expect

- **MEA fee** is low; **total cost** changes with pre-auth (SDM/HRD/CoC), translations, page count (business docs), and courier.  
- **Typical timelines** (after acceptance): many SDM/CoC routes finish in **~2–3 working days**; HRD/university checks can add time.

- Any **pre-verification** (HRD / Home / SDM / CoC) the recipient demands  
- **Translations / affidavits** when names or languages don’t match requirements
