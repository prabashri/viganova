# FAQ shown on the same watch page
faq:
  - question: "Can I host MP4 and still use captions and chapters?"
    answer: "Yes. Provide a `contentUrl` for the MP4, `captions` tracks in .vtt, and a `chapters` array. The layout renders tracks and deep links."
    speakable: true
  - question: "Is a transcript necessary if I already have captions?"
    answer: "Captions help during playback; a full transcript improves accessibility, search, and lets users scan or quote the content."
    speakable: false

## Overview

This page demonstrates a **self-hosted** video using `contentUrl` (MP4), optional captions, chapters with deep links, and a complete transcript below.

---

## Resources

- **MP4 Source:** `contentUrl`
- **Captions:** WebVTT files linked in frontmatter
- **Chapters:** Rendered in the sidebar; links jump using `?t=seconds`
- **Transcript:** Embedded below for searchability and accessibility

## Transcript <a id="transcript"></a>

> Tip: Your `transcriptUrl` in frontmatter points to this section (`/videos/self-hosted-video-example/#transcript`).

**[00:00] Host:** Welcome! In this video we'll walk through hosting your own MP4, adding captions and chapters, and publishing a watch page that’s optimized for SEO and accessibility.

**[00:18] Host:** First, the **file format**. MP4 with H.264/AAC is widely compatible. Store it on a CDN and expose a stable HTTPS `contentUrl`. If you can, enable range requests and good caching headers.

**[00:42] Host:** For **poster art**, include a `poster` image and, optionally, multiple `thumbnails`. The layout will use `poster` for social previews and can use `thumbnails` in UI components.

**[01:03] Host:** Next up: **captions**. Provide WebVTT tracks in the `captions` array. Each track takes a `url`, `lang`, optional `label`, and `default`. This enables accessible playback and improves engagement.

**[01:28] Host:** **Chapters** help viewers jump to the exact section they need. Add a `chapters` array with `name`, `start` (seconds), and optional `end`/`url`. The layout renders deep links like `?t=210`.

**[01:55] Host:** For **dimensions**, set `videoWidth` and `videoHeight`. If you leave `aspectRatio` empty, the layout can compute `16:9` or another ratio based on those dimensions.

**[02:16] Host:** The **watch page** should be canonical for the video. That's why we use `watchPageUrl` and set the `VideoObject` as `mainEntity` via `HeadProps.video.isMainEntity = true` in the layout.

**[02:38] Host:** Include an **FAQ** section in the same page if you can. Short Q&A entries can be output as structured data to answer common queries directly in search.

**[03:00] Host:** Before publishing, test **load time** and **buffering**. A global CDN, proper caching, and compressed poster images make a big difference. If bandwidth spikes are a concern, consider adding HLS later.

**[03:22] Host:** That's it! You now have a self-hosted video watch page with captions, chapters, and a complete transcript. Happy publishing.
